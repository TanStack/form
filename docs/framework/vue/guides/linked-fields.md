title: Link Two Form Fields Together
---

You may find yourself needing to link two fields together; when one is validated as another field's value has changed.
One such usage is when you have both a `password` and `confirm_password` field,
where you want to `confirm_password` to error out when `password`'s value does not match;
regardless of which field triggered the value change.

Imagine the following userflow:

- User updates confirm password field.
- User updates the non-confirm password field.

In this example, the form will still have errors present,
as the "confirm password" field validation has not been re-ran to mark as accepted.

To solve this, we need to make sure that the "confirm password" validation is re-run when the password field is updated.
To do this, you can add a `onChangeListenTo` property to the `confirm_password` field.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from '@tanstack/vue-form'

const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
        password: '',
        confirm_password: '',
    },
    // ...
})
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <form @submit.prevent.stop="form.handleSubmit">
            <div>
                <form.Field name="password">
                    <template v-slot="{ field }">
                        <div>Password:</div>
                        <input 
                            :value="field.state.value"
                            @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)" 
                        />
                    </template>
                </form.Field>
                <form.Field 
                    name="confirm_password" 
                    :validators="{
                        onChangeListenTo: ['password'],
                        onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
                            if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue('password')) {
                                return 'Passwords do not match'
                            }
                            return undefined
                        },
                    }"
                >
                    <template v-slot="{ field }">
                        <div>Confirm Password:</div>
                        <input 
                            :value="field.state.value"
                            @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)" 
                        />
                        <div v-for="(err, index) in field.state.meta.errors" :key="index">{{ err }}</div>
                    </template>
                </form.Field>
            </div>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</template>
```

This similarly works with `onBlurListenTo` property, which will re-run the validation when the field is blurred.
