In a situation where you want to have multiple form submission types, for example, a form that has a button that navigates to a sub-form and another button that handles a standard submission, you can make use of the onSubmitMeta prop and the handleSubmit function overloads.

# Basic Usage

First you must define the default state of the form.onSubmitMeta prop:

```tsx
const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: 'Rick',
    },
    // {} is the default value passed to `onSubmit`'s `meta` property
    onSubmitMeta: {} as { lastName: string },
    onSubmit: async ({ value, meta }) => {

      // Do something with the values passed via handleSubmit
      console.log(`${value.firstName} - ${meta}`)
    },
  })
```

Note: the default state of onSubmitMeta is `never`, so if the prop is not provided and you try to access it in `handleSubmit`, or `onSubmit` it will error.

Then when you call `onSubmit` you can provide it the predefined meta like so:

```tsx
<form
  onSubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    e.stopPropagation()
    form.handleSubmit({
      lastName: 'Astley',
    })
  }}
>
</form>
```
