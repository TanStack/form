This is a quick example of how to wrap the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">React-Select</a> component:\\n```javascript\\n// formReactSelect.js\\n\\nimport React from 'react'\\nimport { FormInput } from 'react-form'\\nimport Select from 'react-select'\\n\\nexport default ({field, ...rest}) => {\\n  return (\\n    <FormInput field={field}> // Use FormInput with a fieldName to get the field's api\\n      // FormInput's only child should be a function that provides you the field api and returns valid jsx or a react component\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <Select\\n            {...rest} // Send the rest of your props to React-Select\\n            value={getValue()} // Set the value to the forms value\\n            onChange={val => setValue(val)} // On Change, update the form value\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()} // And the same goes for touched\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormInput>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n// Now you can use it in a form!\\nimport React from 'react'\\nimport FormReactSelect from './formReactSelect'\\n\\nconst myForm = (\\n  <Form>\\n    <FormReactSelect\\n      field='my.field'\\n      clearable={false}\\n      options={[...]}\\n    />\\n  </Form>\\n})\\n\\n```\\n\\n# API\\n\\n### { Form }\\n- Props\\n  - defaultValues {}\\n  - loadState ()\\n  - preValidate ()\\n  - validate ()\\n  - onValidationFail ()\\n  - onChange ()\\n  - saveState ()\\n  - willUnmount ()\\n  - preSubmit ()\\n  - onSubmit ()\\n  - postSubmit ()\\n- Child can be either:\\n  - A function that returns a component (**this function is called with an object that contains:**)\\n    - Current [Form State](#form-state)\\n    - [Form API methods](#form-api-methods)\\n    - Any other props passed to your form component\\n  - A component or JSX (if you do not need access to any methods or form state)\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { Form } from 'react-form'\\n\\n// Create a new form by passing `Form` and Form props\\nconst myForm = (\\n  <Form\\n    onSubmit={}\\n    validate={() => {...}}\\n    // any other props\\n  >\\n    ...\\n  </Form>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Props\\nEverything in react-form is configurable with the following props.\\n*Note: You can also change the default props for every form component via `FormDefaultProps` (See [{FormDefaultProps}](#-formdefaultprops-))*\\n\\n#### defaultValues {}\\n- To hardcode any default values to the form, just pass them in an object here.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  defaultValues={{\\n    name: 'Tanner Linsley'\\n    hobby: 'javascript'\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### loadState (props, instance)\\n- When a form mounts, `loadState` is called. If a saved [form state object](#form-state) is returned, it will hydrate the form state from this object.\\n- An ideal callback to load the form state from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### preValidate (values, state, props, instance)\\n- This method is a value filter that happens before each validation.\\n- Use it to scrub and/or clean your values before they are validated.\\n- Whatever you return will replace all of the values in that form's state.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  preValidate={(values) => {\\n    values.hobby = values.hobby.substring(0, 6) // Constantly scrub the hobby field to never be more than 6 characters long\\n    return values\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### validate (values, state, props, instance)\\n- Using the current values, you may return an object of error strings that map 1:1 to any fields that do not meet any condition you specify\\n- Any falsey errors will be recursively stripped from the object you return, so if a field is valid, simply return a falsey value of your choice.\\n- If attempting to submit, and `validate` returns any errors, `setAllTouched(true)` will automatically be called on the form. Likewise, if the form has been marked as globally dirty, and no errors are returned, `setAllTouched(false)` will automatically clear the global dirty state\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  validate={({name, password}) => {\\n    return {\\n      name: !name ? 'A name is required' : null,\\n      password: (!password || password.length < 6) ? 'A password of 6 or more characters is required' : null\\n    }\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### onValidationFail (values, state, props, instance)\\n- If and when a forms validation fails, you can handle it here\\n\\n#### onChange (state, props, initial, instance)\\n- Called any time a form's `values` change\\n- If `initial` is set to true, this indicates that the component just mounted and is firing `onChange` for the first time (this is utilized by nested forms)\\n\\n#### saveState (state, props, instance)\\n- Called anytime a form's internal `state` is changed.\\n- An ideal callback to export/save the [form state](#form-state) from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### willUnmount (state, props, instance)\\n- Called when a form is about to unmount\\n- An ideal callback to remove the [form state](#form-state) from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### preSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- This method is a value filter that happens after validation and before a successful submission.\\n- Use it to scrub and/or clean your values before they are submitted.\\n- Whatever you return will **not** replace all of the values in that form's state, but will be passed to the `onSubmit` method.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  preSubmit={(values) => {\\n    values.hobby = values.hobby.toLowerCase() // Scrub the hobby field to be lowercase on submit\\n    return values\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### onSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- When a form is successfully submitted via [`submitForm`](#submitform-), this method will be called with the values of the parent form.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n// Per Instance (usually this way)\\n<Form\\n  onSubmit={(values) => {\\n    console.log('Form Submitted with these values:', values)\\n  }}\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n#### postSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- After a form is successfully submitted via `submitForm`, this method will be called.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  postSubmit={(values) => {\\n    console.log('Success!', values)\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### component (string / component / false)\\n- If truthy, the form will use the tag or component as the root for the form.\\n- If falsey, the form will not be wrapped and you must return a single element from your form's children or render function\\n- Defaults to 'div'\\n- If using a custom component, make sure to pass through all props, including `children` for your form to render correctly\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  component={props => (\\n    <CustomComponent {...props} />\\n  )}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Form API\\nWhen a function is passed as the child of a form, it is passed the form API as a parameter. eg.\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {(api) => {\\n    ...\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\nThis also makes it extremely easy to destructure exactly what you need from the api!\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({submitForm, values, addValue, removeValue}) => {\\n    ...\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\nThe form API is a merge of the form state object and API methods\\n\\n### Form State\\n\\n#### values {}\\n- The current read-only values in the form state.\\n- Again, these values are immutable, so just like any traditional react state or redux state, they should not be changed or mutated outside of the form lifecycle methods\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({values}) => {\\n    console.log(values)\\n    // {\\n    //   name: 'Tanner Linsley',\\n    //   hobby: 'Javascript',\\n    //   nestedForm: {\\n    //     notes: 'These are some notes from a nested form'\\n    //   }\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### errors {}\\n- The current read-only errors in the form state.\\n- This prop is not recommended for displaying errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- Errors are set via the optional `validate` lifecycle method\\n- Defaults to `null`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({errors}) => {\\n    console.log(errors)\\n    // {\\n    //   name: 'Name is required and must be at least 5 characters',\\n    //   hobby: 'Required',\\n    //   nestedForm: 'Requires some valid nested fields' // See \\\"nestedErrors\\\" section\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### nestedErrors {}\\n- The current read-only nested form errors in the form state\\n- `nestedErrors` is an object map indicating any nested forms that did not pass their own validation\\n- This prop is not recommended for displaying nested form errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- If a nested form contains an error in its own validation lifecycle method, its corresponding `nestedErrors` field will be set to true.\\n- Defaults to `{}`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({nestedErrors}) => {\\n    console.log(nestedErrors)\\n    // {\\n    //   nestedForm: true // there must be an error in the form located at the \\\"nestedForm\\\" field\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### touched {}\\n- The current read-only touched fields map in the form state\\n- When a field is changed via `setValue()` or `setTouched()`, its corresponding field location in this object is marked as true.\\n- This props is not recommended for displaying errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- Defaults to `{}`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({touched}) => {\\n    console.log(touched)\\n    // {\\n    //   touched: { myField: true } // the `myField` field has been touched\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n### Form API methods\\n\\n#### setAllValues (values, noTouch)\\n- Sets (replaces) all form values to `values`\\n- If `noTouch` is true, the `touched` state of the field won't change.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setAllValues}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setAllValues({\\n        name: 'Tanner Linsley',\\n        job: 'Software Developer',\\n        age: 27\\n      })}>\\n        Set all field values\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setValue (field, value, noTouch)\\n- Sets any given `field` to `value`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- The field will be created if it does not exist and will automatically infer object/array structure from field location\\n- If `noTouch` is true, the `touched` state of the field won't change.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setValue('some.field', true)}>\\n        Set Some Field to TRUE\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### getValue (field, fallback)\\n- Gets the current value located at `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- You can pass a `fallback` value which will be used if the field does not exist or if its `value === undefined`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Value: {getValue('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setNestedError (field, value)\\n- Mostly used internally, this method sets the `field` in `nestedErrors` to `value` to indicate that a nested form did or did not not pass its own validation.\\n- If a nested form error is set, its value in its parent `validate` lifecycle method will be set to undefined.\\n- This is necessary to check if a nested form is valid from a the parent form's `validate` lifecycle method.\\n- For example usage, see the source for the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-form/blob/master/src/formInputs/form.js\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">`NestedForm` component</a>\\n\\n#### getError (field)\\n- Gets the current error located at `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getError}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Error: {getError('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setTouched (field, value = true)\\n- Sets the `field` in the `touched` state to `value` (which defaults to true). Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setTouched('some.field', true)}>\\n        Set some fields touched value to TRUE\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### getTouched (field)\\n- Gets the current touched value for `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Touched: {getTouched('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n\\n#### addValue (field, value)\\n- Pushes `value` into an **array-like** `field` as a new value.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({addValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => addValue('todos', {})}>\\n        Add Todo\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### removeValue (field, index)\\n- Removes the field at the specified index from an **array-like** `field`.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({removeValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        {todos.map((todo, i) => {\\n          return (\\n            <button onClick={() => removeValue('todos', i)}>\\n              Remove Todo\\n            </button>\\n          )\\n        })}\\n      </div>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### swapValues (field, i, j)\\n- Swaps the fields at the specified indices inside an **array-like** `field`.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({swapValues}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        {todos.map((todo, i) => {\\n          return (\\n            <button onClick={() => swapValues('todos', i, i - 1)}>\\n              Move Up\\n            </button>\\n          )\\n        })}\\n      </div>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setAllTouched (value = true)\\n- Sets the form's `dirty` state to `!!value` (which defaults to `true`). If `true`, its value will override any value retrieved using `getTouched`.\\n- When set to true, all validation errors in a form will be visible regardless if they are touched.\\n- Used internally by the `submitForm` lifecycle method when a forms validation is failed\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setAllTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={setAllTouched}>\\n        Touch / Dirty the entire form // innuendo? hmm....\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### resetForm ()\\n- Resets all of the values of the form back to it's default values.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({resetForm}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={resetForm}>\\n        Start over!\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### submitForm ()\\n- Submits the form with the following optional lifecycle events:\\n  - `preValidate(values, state, props)` filter your values before they are validated\\n  - `validate(values, state, props)` validate your form\\n  - `onValidationFail(state, props)` handle failed validation (if applicable)\\n  - `preSubmit(values, state, props)` filter your values before they are successfully submitted\\n  - `onSubmit(values, state, props)` handle the submission\\n  - `postSubmit(values, state, props)` handle after a successful submission\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  onSubmit={(values, state, props) => {\\n    console.log(values)\\n  }}\\n>\\n  {({submitForm}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <form onSubmit={submitForm}>\\n        <button type='submit'>Submit Form</button>\\n      </form>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### { FormDefaultProps }\\n- An object of the global default props for every react-form you create.\\n- You can assign new global defaults to this object anywhere before creating a new react-form\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormDefaultProps } from 'react-form'\\n\\nObject.assign(FormDefaultProps, {\\n  onValidationFail: () => { console.log('uh oh...') }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n### { FormInput }\\n- A higher-order component to create new input types quickly.\\n- Automatically shows errors and receives error classes (.-has-error) for the field given\\n- The only child of `FormInput` must be a function that returns valid JSX. This function is passed one parameter, the form api object.\\n- The form api object contains every method to manage the form's state.\\n- If a `field` prop is passed, every API method will be auto-bound to use that `field`. Otherwise, they operate at the form-level as usual.\\n- If the `showErrors` prop is set to `false`, errors will be hidden\\n- If the `errorBefore` prop is set to `true`, any error will be shown before the component, instead of after\\n- If the `isForm` props is set to `true`, the field error will only be shown if the parent form has been unsuccessfully submitted. This is normally only used for `NestedForm` components to avoid unnecessary or duplicate error messages.\\n\\n**Example** - A simple wrapper for React Select\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormInput } from 'react-form'\\nimport ReactSelect from 'react-select'\\n\\nexport default ({field, ...rest}) => {\\n  return (\\n    <FormInput field={field}>\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <ReactSelect\\n            {...rest}\\n            value={getValue()}\\n            onChange={val => setValue(val)}\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()}\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormInput>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### { FormError }\\n- Displays an error message for the given field\\n- Will only display if both an error for that field exists and it has been touched.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormError } from 'react-form'\\n\\nconst example = (\\n  <FormError field='my.field' />\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### { FormField }\\n- A low-level react component that can be used anywhere within a form to expose the api for any field.\\n- The only child of `FormField` must be a function that returns valid JSX. This function is passed one parameter, the form api object.\\n- The form api object contains every method to manage the form's state.\\n- If a `field` prop is passed, every API method will be auto-bound to use that field. Otherwise, they operate at the form-level as usual.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormField } from 'react-form'\\n\\nfunction customInput ({field, ...rest}) {\\n  return (\\n    <FormField field={field}>\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <input\\n            value={getValue()}\\n            onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()}\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormField>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Form Components\\nReact-Form ships with plenty of standard form components and even provides an extremely easy way to create your own custom form components\\n\\n### { Text }\\n### { Select }\\n### { Checkbox }\\n### { Textarea }\\n### { RadioGroup, Radio }\\n- These are all pre-packaged form inputs created with our very own `FormInput` component.\\n- Each requires a `field` prop to be passed\\n- All other props will be passed through to the underlying input component\\n- Automatically show errors and receive error classes (.-has-error). Set the `showErrors` prop to `false` to disable\\n- To display the error before the component, set the `errorBefore` prop to `true`\\n- Their source serves as great example of how to create your own custom Form Inputs\\n- Pass `noTouch` to avoid validation while the value is changing\\n- You may pass onBlur and onChange functions to augment their behaviour. Your function will be called with the event and the original function which you may choose to call. Radio does not have an onChange handler but you may augment the onClick handler in the same fashion.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { Text, Select, Checkbox, Textarea, Radio, RadioGroup } from 'react-form'\\n\\nconst example = (\\n  <div>\\n\\n    <Text\\n      onChange{(e, onChange) => {\\n        console.log('it changed')\\n        onChange()\\n      }}\\n      field='name'\\n      placeholder='Full name'\\n    />\\n\\n    <Select\\n      field='employed'\\n      options={[{\\n        label: 'Employed',\\n        values: true\\n      }, {\\n        label: 'Unemployed',\\n        value: false\\n      }]}\\n    />\\n\\n    <Checkbox\\n      field='createAccount'\\n    />\\n\\n    <Textarea\\n      field='notes'\\n      placeholder='Notes'\\n    />\\n\\n    <RadioGroup field='notificationType'>\\n      <Radio value='email'/>\\n      <Radio value='text'/>\\n      <Radio value='phone'/>\\n    </RadioGroup>\\n\\n  </div>\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### { NestedForm }\\n- React forms can be composed and nested at any depth or level of granularity and each nested form has it's own unique lifecycle. This can be extremely useful for avoiding large or deep validation functions, or breaking up complex forms.\\n- Nested forms propagate their values as an `object` to their assigned field on their parent form.\\n- Invalid nested forms pass `undefined` to their parent's validation function in place of the nested form's values. For instance, if a nested form using the field `myNestedForm` has an error, the parent validation function might look like this:\\n```javascript\\n  validate ({name, hobby, myNestedForm}) {\\n    return {\\n      // normal validation...\\n      myNestedForm: !myNestedForm ? 'Name Required' : undefined,\\n    }\\n  }\\n```\\n- Nested forms cannot be submitted on their own and cannot use nested `<Form />` elements (which would be invalid HTML).\\n- Nested forms perform all of the standard form lifecycle methods except for those that are submission related\\n  - `onValidationFail`\\n  - `preSubmit`\\n  - `onSubmit`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Contributing\\nTo suggest a feature, create an issue if it does not already exist.\\nIf you would like to help develop a suggested feature follow these steps:\\n\\n- Fork this repo\\n- `$ yarn`\\n- `$ yarn run storybook`\\n- Implement your changes to files in the `src/` directory\\n- View changes as you code via our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">React Storybook</a> `localhost:8000`\\n- Make changes to stories in `/stories`, or create a new one if needed\\n- Submit PR for review\\n\\n#### Scripts\\n\\n- `$ yarn run storybook` Runs the storybook server\\n- `$ yarn run test` Runs the test suite\\n- `$ yarn run prepublish` Builds the distributable bundle\\n- `$ yarn run docs` Builds the website/docs from the storybook for github pages\\n\\n## Used By\\n\\n<a href='https://nozzle.io' target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">\\n  <img src='https://nozzle.io/img/logo-blue.png' alt='Nozzle Logo' style='width:300px;'/>\\n</a>\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 164 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */\\nimport React from 'react'\\n//\\nimport { Form, Checkbox } from '../../../lib/index'\\nimport CodeHighlight from './components/CodeHighlight'\\n\\nclass Story extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Form\\n        defaultValues={{\\n          subscribe: true,\\n          adult: false\\n        }}\\n      >\\n        {({ submitForm, values }) => {\\n          return (\\n            <form onSubmit={submitForm}>\\n              <p>Submit event would have 3 objects: values, state and props.</p>\\n              <br />\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"subscribe\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    subscribe to newsletter <pre>[default is true]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"adult\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    I am over 18 years old <pre>[default is false]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"ads\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    subscribe to advertisements\\n                    {' '}\\n                    <pre>[no default value is set]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n              <br />\\n              <br />\\n              <strong>Values:</strong>\\n              <CodeHighlight language=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n                {JSON.stringify(values, null, 2)}\\n              </CodeHighlight>\\n            </form>\\n          )\\n        }}\\n      </Form>\\n    )\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// Source Code\\nconst source = require('!raw!./Checkbox')\\n\\nexport default () => (\\n  <div>\\n    <Story />\\n    <strong>Source: </strong><br /><CodeHighlight>{source}</CodeHighlight>\\n  </div>\\n)\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 165 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */\\nimport React from 'react'\\n//\\nimport {\\n  Form,\\n  FormError,\\n  Text,\\n  Select,\\n  Textarea,\\n  Checkbox,\\n  RadioGroup,\\n  Radio,\\n  NestedForm\\n} from '../../../lib/index'\\n\\nimport CodeHighlight from './components/CodeHighlight'\\n\\nclass Story extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    // This is our reusable address form\\n    const AddressForm = (\\n      <Form\\n        // It can have its own validation function!\\n        validate={values => {\\n          return {\\n            street: !values.street ?

This is a quick example of how to wrap the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">React-Select</a> component:\\n```javascript\\n// formReactSelect.js\\n\\nimport React from 'react'\\nimport { FormInput } from 'react-form'\\nimport Select from 'react-select'\\n\\nexport default ({field, ...rest}) => {\\n  return (\\n    <FormInput field={field}> // Use FormInput with a fieldName to get the field's api\\n      // FormInput's only child should be a function that provides you the field api and returns valid jsx or a react component\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <Select\\n            {...rest} // Send the rest of your props to React-Select\\n            value={getValue()} // Set the value to the forms value\\n            onChange={val => setValue(val)} // On Change, update the form value\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()} // And the same goes for touched\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormInput>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n// Now you can use it in a form!\\nimport React from 'react'\\nimport FormReactSelect from './formReactSelect'\\n\\nconst myForm = (\\n  <Form>\\n    <FormReactSelect\\n      field='my.field'\\n      clearable={false}\\n      options={[...]}\\n    />\\n  </Form>\\n})\\n\\n```\\n\\n# API\\n\\n### { Form }\\n- Props\\n  - defaultValues {}\\n  - loadState ()\\n  - preValidate ()\\n  - validate ()\\n  - onValidationFail ()\\n  - onChange ()\\n  - saveState ()\\n  - willUnmount ()\\n  - preSubmit ()\\n  - onSubmit ()\\n  - postSubmit ()\\n- Child can be either:\\n  - A function that returns a component (**this function is called with an object that contains:**)\\n    - Current [Form State](#form-state)\\n    - [Form API methods](#form-api-methods)\\n    - Any other props passed to your form component\\n  - A component or JSX (if you do not need access to any methods or form state)\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { Form } from 'react-form'\\n\\n// Create a new form by passing `Form` and Form props\\nconst myForm = (\\n  <Form\\n    onSubmit={}\\n    validate={() => {...}}\\n    // any other props\\n  >\\n    ...\\n  </Form>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Props\\nEverything in react-form is configurable with the following props.\\n*Note: You can also change the default props for every form component via `FormDefaultProps` (See [{FormDefaultProps}](#-formdefaultprops-))*\\n\\n#### defaultValues {}\\n- To hardcode any default values to the form, just pass them in an object here.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  defaultValues={{\\n    name: 'Tanner Linsley'\\n    hobby: 'javascript'\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### loadState (props, instance)\\n- When a form mounts, `loadState` is called. If a saved [form state object](#form-state) is returned, it will hydrate the form state from this object.\\n- An ideal callback to load the form state from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### preValidate (values, state, props, instance)\\n- This method is a value filter that happens before each validation.\\n- Use it to scrub and/or clean your values before they are validated.\\n- Whatever you return will replace all of the values in that form's state.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  preValidate={(values) => {\\n    values.hobby = values.hobby.substring(0, 6) // Constantly scrub the hobby field to never be more than 6 characters long\\n    return values\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### validate (values, state, props, instance)\\n- Using the current values, you may return an object of error strings that map 1:1 to any fields that do not meet any condition you specify\\n- Any falsey errors will be recursively stripped from the object you return, so if a field is valid, simply return a falsey value of your choice.\\n- If attempting to submit, and `validate` returns any errors, `setAllTouched(true)` will automatically be called on the form. Likewise, if the form has been marked as globally dirty, and no errors are returned, `setAllTouched(false)` will automatically clear the global dirty state\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  validate={({name, password}) => {\\n    return {\\n      name: !name ? 'A name is required' : null,\\n      password: (!password || password.length < 6) ? 'A password of 6 or more characters is required' : null\\n    }\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### onValidationFail (values, state, props, instance)\\n- If and when a forms validation fails, you can handle it here\\n\\n#### onChange (state, props, initial, instance)\\n- Called any time a form's `values` change\\n- If `initial` is set to true, this indicates that the component just mounted and is firing `onChange` for the first time (this is utilized by nested forms)\\n\\n#### saveState (state, props, instance)\\n- Called anytime a form's internal `state` is changed.\\n- An ideal callback to export/save the [form state](#form-state) from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### willUnmount (state, props, instance)\\n- Called when a form is about to unmount\\n- An ideal callback to remove the [form state](#form-state) from an external state manager (Redux/MobX/other)\\n\\n#### preSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- This method is a value filter that happens after validation and before a successful submission.\\n- Use it to scrub and/or clean your values before they are submitted.\\n- Whatever you return will **not** replace all of the values in that form's state, but will be passed to the `onSubmit` method.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  preSubmit={(values) => {\\n    values.hobby = values.hobby.toLowerCase() // Scrub the hobby field to be lowercase on submit\\n    return values\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### onSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- When a form is successfully submitted via [`submitForm`](#submitform-), this method will be called with the values of the parent form.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n// Per Instance (usually this way)\\n<Form\\n  onSubmit={(values) => {\\n    console.log('Form Submitted with these values:', values)\\n  }}\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n#### postSubmit (values, state, props, instance)\\n- After a form is successfully submitted via `submitForm`, this method will be called.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  postSubmit={(values) => {\\n    console.log('Success!', values)\\n  }}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n#### component (string / component / false)\\n- If truthy, the form will use the tag or component as the root for the form.\\n- If falsey, the form will not be wrapped and you must return a single element from your form's children or render function\\n- Defaults to 'div'\\n- If using a custom component, make sure to pass through all props, including `children` for your form to render correctly\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  component={props => (\\n    <CustomComponent {...props} />\\n  )}\\n>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Form API\\nWhen a function is passed as the child of a form, it is passed the form API as a parameter. eg.\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {(api) => {\\n    ...\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\nThis also makes it extremely easy to destructure exactly what you need from the api!\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({submitForm, values, addValue, removeValue}) => {\\n    ...\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\nThe form API is a merge of the form state object and API methods\\n\\n### Form State\\n\\n#### values {}\\n- The current read-only values in the form state.\\n- Again, these values are immutable, so just like any traditional react state or redux state, they should not be changed or mutated outside of the form lifecycle methods\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({values}) => {\\n    console.log(values)\\n    // {\\n    //   name: 'Tanner Linsley',\\n    //   hobby: 'Javascript',\\n    //   nestedForm: {\\n    //     notes: 'These are some notes from a nested form'\\n    //   }\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### errors {}\\n- The current read-only errors in the form state.\\n- This prop is not recommended for displaying errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- Errors are set via the optional `validate` lifecycle method\\n- Defaults to `null`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({errors}) => {\\n    console.log(errors)\\n    // {\\n    //   name: 'Name is required and must be at least 5 characters',\\n    //   hobby: 'Required',\\n    //   nestedForm: 'Requires some valid nested fields' // See \\\"nestedErrors\\\" section\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### nestedErrors {}\\n- The current read-only nested form errors in the form state\\n- `nestedErrors` is an object map indicating any nested forms that did not pass their own validation\\n- This prop is not recommended for displaying nested form errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- If a nested form contains an error in its own validation lifecycle method, its corresponding `nestedErrors` field will be set to true.\\n- Defaults to `{}`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({nestedErrors}) => {\\n    console.log(nestedErrors)\\n    // {\\n    //   nestedForm: true // there must be an error in the form located at the \\\"nestedForm\\\" field\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### touched {}\\n- The current read-only touched fields map in the form state\\n- When a field is changed via `setValue()` or `setTouched()`, its corresponding field location in this object is marked as true.\\n- This props is not recommended for displaying errors. For that, we recommend relying on a `FormInput` or using the `FieldError` component.\\n- Defaults to `{}`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({touched}) => {\\n    console.log(touched)\\n    // {\\n    //   touched: { myField: true } // the `myField` field has been touched\\n    // }\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n### Form API methods\\n\\n#### setAllValues (values, noTouch)\\n- Sets (replaces) all form values to `values`\\n- If `noTouch` is true, the `touched` state of the field won't change.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setAllValues}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setAllValues({\\n        name: 'Tanner Linsley',\\n        job: 'Software Developer',\\n        age: 27\\n      })}>\\n        Set all field values\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setValue (field, value, noTouch)\\n- Sets any given `field` to `value`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- The field will be created if it does not exist and will automatically infer object/array structure from field location\\n- If `noTouch` is true, the `touched` state of the field won't change.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setValue('some.field', true)}>\\n        Set Some Field to TRUE\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### getValue (field, fallback)\\n- Gets the current value located at `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- You can pass a `fallback` value which will be used if the field does not exist or if its `value === undefined`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Value: {getValue('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setNestedError (field, value)\\n- Mostly used internally, this method sets the `field` in `nestedErrors` to `value` to indicate that a nested form did or did not not pass its own validation.\\n- If a nested form error is set, its value in its parent `validate` lifecycle method will be set to undefined.\\n- This is necessary to check if a nested form is valid from a the parent form's `validate` lifecycle method.\\n- For example usage, see the source for the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-form/blob/master/src/formInputs/form.js\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">`NestedForm` component</a>\\n\\n#### getError (field)\\n- Gets the current error located at `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getError}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Error: {getError('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setTouched (field, value = true)\\n- Sets the `field` in the `touched` state to `value` (which defaults to true). Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => setTouched('some.field', true)}>\\n        Set some fields touched value to TRUE\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### getTouched (field)\\n- Gets the current touched value for `field`. Usually this functionality is contained in an InputField of sorts, but it is still available on the form itself in its generic form.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({getTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <span>Current Touched: {getTouched('my.field')}</span>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n\\n#### addValue (field, value)\\n- Pushes `value` into an **array-like** `field` as a new value.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({addValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={() => addValue('todos', {})}>\\n        Add Todo\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### removeValue (field, index)\\n- Removes the field at the specified index from an **array-like** `field`.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({removeValue}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        {todos.map((todo, i) => {\\n          return (\\n            <button onClick={() => removeValue('todos', i)}>\\n              Remove Todo\\n            </button>\\n          )\\n        })}\\n      </div>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### swapValues (field, i, j)\\n- Swaps the fields at the specified indices inside an **array-like** `field`.\\n- `field` can be a **string or array property location** eg.\\n  - `my.field.name` == `['my', 'field', 'name']`\\n  - `my.fields[3]` == `['my', 'fields', 3]`\\n  - Array properties can also be nested (great for passing down via props) `[['my', 'fields'], [5], 'stuff']` == `my.fields[5].stuff`\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({swapValues}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        {todos.map((todo, i) => {\\n          return (\\n            <button onClick={() => swapValues('todos', i, i - 1)}>\\n              Move Up\\n            </button>\\n          )\\n        })}\\n      </div>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### setAllTouched (value = true)\\n- Sets the form's `dirty` state to `!!value` (which defaults to `true`). If `true`, its value will override any value retrieved using `getTouched`.\\n- When set to true, all validation errors in a form will be visible regardless if they are touched.\\n- Used internally by the `submitForm` lifecycle method when a forms validation is failed\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({setAllTouched}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={setAllTouched}>\\n        Touch / Dirty the entire form // innuendo? hmm....\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### resetForm ()\\n- Resets all of the values of the form back to it's default values.\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form>\\n  {({resetForm}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <button onClick={resetForm}>\\n        Start over!\\n      </button>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n#### submitForm ()\\n- Submits the form with the following optional lifecycle events:\\n  - `preValidate(values, state, props)` filter your values before they are validated\\n  - `validate(values, state, props)` validate your form\\n  - `onValidationFail(state, props)` handle failed validation (if applicable)\\n  - `preSubmit(values, state, props)` filter your values before they are successfully submitted\\n  - `onSubmit(values, state, props)` handle the submission\\n  - `postSubmit(values, state, props)` handle after a successful submission\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\n<Form\\n  onSubmit={(values, state, props) => {\\n    console.log(values)\\n  }}\\n>\\n  {({submitForm}) => {\\n    return (\\n      <form onSubmit={submitForm}>\\n        <button type='submit'>Submit Form</button>\\n      </form>\\n    )\\n  }}\\n</Form>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### { FormDefaultProps }\\n- An object of the global default props for every react-form you create.\\n- You can assign new global defaults to this object anywhere before creating a new react-form\\n- Example:\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormDefaultProps } from 'react-form'\\n\\nObject.assign(FormDefaultProps, {\\n  onValidationFail: () => { console.log('uh oh...') }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n### { FormInput }\\n- A higher-order component to create new input types quickly.\\n- Automatically shows errors and receives error classes (.-has-error) for the field given\\n- The only child of `FormInput` must be a function that returns valid JSX. This function is passed one parameter, the form api object.\\n- The form api object contains every method to manage the form's state.\\n- If a `field` prop is passed, every API method will be auto-bound to use that `field`. Otherwise, they operate at the form-level as usual.\\n- If the `showErrors` prop is set to `false`, errors will be hidden\\n- If the `errorBefore` prop is set to `true`, any error will be shown before the component, instead of after\\n- If the `isForm` props is set to `true`, the field error will only be shown if the parent form has been unsuccessfully submitted. This is normally only used for `NestedForm` components to avoid unnecessary or duplicate error messages.\\n\\n**Example** - A simple wrapper for React Select\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormInput } from 'react-form'\\nimport ReactSelect from 'react-select'\\n\\nexport default ({field, ...rest}) => {\\n  return (\\n    <FormInput field={field}>\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <ReactSelect\\n            {...rest}\\n            value={getValue()}\\n            onChange={val => setValue(val)}\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()}\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormInput>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### { FormError }\\n- Displays an error message for the given field\\n- Will only display if both an error for that field exists and it has been touched.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormError } from 'react-form'\\n\\nconst example = (\\n  <FormError field='my.field' />\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### { FormField }\\n- A low-level react component that can be used anywhere within a form to expose the api for any field.\\n- The only child of `FormField` must be a function that returns valid JSX. This function is passed one parameter, the form api object.\\n- The form api object contains every method to manage the form's state.\\n- If a `field` prop is passed, every API method will be auto-bound to use that field. Otherwise, they operate at the form-level as usual.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { FormField } from 'react-form'\\n\\nfunction customInput ({field, ...rest}) {\\n  return (\\n    <FormField field={field}>\\n      {({ setValue, getValue, setTouched }) => {\\n        return (\\n          <input\\n            value={getValue()}\\n            onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}\\n            onBlur={() => setTouched()}\\n          />\\n        )\\n      }}\\n    </FormField>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Form Components\\nReact-Form ships with plenty of standard form components and even provides an extremely easy way to create your own custom form components\\n\\n### { Text }\\n### { Select }\\n### { Checkbox }\\n### { Textarea }\\n### { RadioGroup, Radio }\\n- These are all pre-packaged form inputs created with our very own `FormInput` component.\\n- Each requires a `field` prop to be passed\\n- All other props will be passed through to the underlying input component\\n- Automatically show errors and receive error classes (.-has-error). Set the `showErrors` prop to `false` to disable\\n- To display the error before the component, set the `errorBefore` prop to `true`\\n- Their source serves as great example of how to create your own custom Form Inputs\\n- Pass `noTouch` to avoid validation while the value is changing\\n- You may pass onBlur and onChange functions to augment their behaviour. Your function will be called with the event and the original function which you may choose to call. Radio does not have an onChange handler but you may augment the onClick handler in the same fashion.\\n\\n**Example**\\n```javascript\\nimport { Text, Select, Checkbox, Textarea, Radio, RadioGroup } from 'react-form'\\n\\nconst example = (\\n  <div>\\n\\n    <Text\\n      onChange{(e, onChange) => {\\n        console.log('it changed')\\n        onChange()\\n      }}\\n      field='name'\\n      placeholder='Full name'\\n    />\\n\\n    <Select\\n      field='employed'\\n      options={[{\\n        label: 'Employed',\\n        values: true\\n      }, {\\n        label: 'Unemployed',\\n        value: false\\n      }]}\\n    />\\n\\n    <Checkbox\\n      field='createAccount'\\n    />\\n\\n    <Textarea\\n      field='notes'\\n      placeholder='Notes'\\n    />\\n\\n    <RadioGroup field='notificationType'>\\n      <Radio value='email'/>\\n      <Radio value='text'/>\\n      <Radio value='phone'/>\\n    </RadioGroup>\\n\\n  </div>\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### { NestedForm }\\n- React forms can be composed and nested at any depth or level of granularity and each nested form has it's own unique lifecycle. This can be extremely useful for avoiding large or deep validation functions, or breaking up complex forms.\\n- Nested forms propagate their values as an `object` to their assigned field on their parent form.\\n- Invalid nested forms pass `undefined` to their parent's validation function in place of the nested form's values. For instance, if a nested form using the field `myNestedForm` has an error, the parent validation function might look like this:\\n```javascript\\n  validate ({name, hobby, myNestedForm}) {\\n    return {\\n      // normal validation...\\n      myNestedForm: !myNestedForm ? 'Name Required' : undefined,\\n    }\\n  }\\n```\\n- Nested forms cannot be submitted on their own and cannot use nested `<Form />` elements (which would be invalid HTML).\\n- Nested forms perform all of the standard form lifecycle methods except for those that are submission related\\n  - `onValidationFail`\\n  - `preSubmit`\\n  - `onSubmit`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Contributing\\nTo suggest a feature, create an issue if it does not already exist.\\nIf you would like to help develop a suggested feature follow these steps:\\n\\n- Fork this repo\\n- `$ yarn`\\n- `$ yarn run storybook`\\n- Implement your changes to files in the `src/` directory\\n- View changes as you code via our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook\\\" target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">React Storybook</a> `localhost:8000`\\n- Make changes to stories in `/stories`, or create a new one if needed\\n- Submit PR for review\\n\\n#### Scripts\\n\\n- `$ yarn run storybook` Runs the storybook server\\n- `$ yarn run test` Runs the test suite\\n- `$ yarn run prepublish` Builds the distributable bundle\\n- `$ yarn run docs` Builds the website/docs from the storybook for github pages\\n\\n## Used By\\n\\n<a href='https://nozzle.io' target=\\\"\\\\_parent\\\">\\n  <img src='https://nozzle.io/img/logo-blue.png' alt='Nozzle Logo' style='width:300px;'/>\\n</a>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!../README.md\n// module id = 163\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */\\nimport React from 'react'\\n//\\nimport { Form, Checkbox } from '../../../lib/index'\\nimport CodeHighlight from './components/CodeHighlight'\\n\\nclass Story extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Form\\n        defaultValues={{\\n          subscribe: true,\\n          adult: false\\n        }}\\n      >\\n        {({ submitForm, values }) => {\\n          return (\\n            <form onSubmit={submitForm}>\\n              <p>Submit event would have 3 objects: values, state and props.</p>\\n              <br />\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"subscribe\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    subscribe to newsletter <pre>[default is true]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"adult\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    I am over 18 years old <pre>[default is false]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <div>\\n                <label>\\n                  <Checkbox field=\\\"ads\\\" />\\n                  <span>\\n                    subscribe to advertisements\\n                    {' '}\\n                    <pre>[no default value is set]</pre>\\n                  </span>\\n                </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n              <br />\\n              <br />\\n              <strong>Values:</strong>\\n              <CodeHighlight language=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n                {JSON.stringify(values, null, 2)}\\n              </CodeHighlight>\\n            </form>\\n          )\\n        }}\\n      </Form>\\n    )\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// Source Code\\nconst source = require('!raw!./Checkbox')\\n\\nexport default () => (\\n  <div>\\n    <Story />\\n    <strong>Source: </strong><br /><CodeHighlight>{source}</CodeHighlight>\\n  </div>\\n)\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./src/stories/Checkbox.js\n// module id = 164\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */\\nimport React from 'react'\\n//\\nimport {\\n  Form,\\n  FormError,\\n  Text,\\n  Select,\\n  Textarea,\\n  Checkbox,\\n  RadioGroup,\\n  Radio,\\n  NestedForm\\n} from '../../../lib/index'\\n\\nimport CodeHighlight from './components/CodeHighlight'\\n\\nclass Story extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    // This is our reusable address form\\n    const AddressForm = (\\n      <Form\\n        // It can have its own validation function!\\n        validate={values => {\\n          return {\\n            street: !values.street ?
