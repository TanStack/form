While the core of TanStack Form is framework-agnostic and will be compatible with various front-end frameworks in the future, we only support React today.
To use TanStack Form with React, install the adapter via NPM

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/react-form
```

> Depending on your environment, you might need to add polyfills. If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from `node_modules` yourselves.
